### What is scripting and how is it different to coding/programming?
- Scripting is writing short programs for automation and repetitive operations.
- Scripting is faster and simpler than programming and focuses on simple tasks whereas programming involves developing more complex systems that may take weeks or months to complete.
- Main difference is the scope and complexity of the project, scripting can be considered to be a subset of programming more geared towards speed and simplicity.

### Why are scripts useful? How are they used?
- Scripts are useful because they automate repetitive tasks and make everyday operations more efficient.
- Commonly used for system administration, data processing, web development and other tasks that need to be performed quickly and efficiently.

### Why Python for scripting? Why not another language?
- Python is widely used for scripting due to its ease of use, readability and versatility.
- Python uses an interpreter to translate and run its code and that's why it's called a scripting language.

### Why is scripting important for DevOps engineers?
- Scripting is vital for DevOps engineers as it automates tasks, manages infrastructure, facilitates collaboration, tracks changes, and ensures standardization, resulting in an efficient and streamlined DevOps process.

### 10 examples of ways we can use scripts in DevOps (for example - Python script to query a database etc.)
- Running system and application performance analysis using a script, for example with Python's psutil module or top.
- Extracting, transforming, and loading data using a script, for example with Python's Pandas library or Apache NiFi.
- Automating and simplifying the configuration and management of cloud-based services, for example with Python's Boto3 library or Azure CLI.
- Managing and automating software builds and deployments, for example with Jenkins or TravisCI.
- Performing batch processing and data analysis, for example with Python's NumPy library or Apache Spark.
- Monitoring and alerting on system events and metrics, for example with Python's logging library or Nagios.
- Provisioning and managing infrastructure, for example with Terraform or CloudFormation.
- Testing and validating system functionality and behavior, for example with Python's unittest library or JUnit.
- Debugging and troubleshooting issues in complex systems, for example with Python's pdb library or GDB.
- Integrating and connecting different tools and systems, for example with Python's JenkinsAPI library or Scripted REST APIs in JIRA.

### List 10 of the most important Python Modules for DevOps (link to each ones documentation if possible)
